# example-robot

An example project from programming a robot with sertain. See [sertain](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/sertain) for
more information about the framework.

Note: You must configure the gradle build file to use your location of the sertain jar, like so:
```
compile fileTree("folder/containing/sertain") {
  include "*.jar"
}
```
